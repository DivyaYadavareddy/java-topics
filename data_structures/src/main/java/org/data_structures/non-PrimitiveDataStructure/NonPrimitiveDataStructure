Non Primitive Data Structure
  Which are created by using primitive data structure
  These data structures can't be manipulated or operated directly by machine-level instructions.
  The focus of these data structures is on forming a set of data elements that is either homogeneous (same data type) or heterogeneous (different data types).
  Based on the structure and arrangement of data, we can divide these data structures into two sub-categories
  1.Linear Data Structures
  2.Non-Linear Data Structures

1. Linear Data Structures :-
    If the elements of a data structure are stored in sequential or linear order then it is a linear data structure
    Examples : arrays,linkedLists,stacks,queues
This is represented by 2 ways
1. One way is to have a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations
2. The other way is to have a linear relationship between elements by means of links

2. Non-Linear Data Structure :-
   However, If the elements of a data structure not stored in a sequential order is known as non-linear data-structure
   --> The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between elements of a non-linear data structure.
      example: Trees, Graphs, heap, hash
